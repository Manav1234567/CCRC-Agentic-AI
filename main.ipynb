      "Australian droughts, particularly multi-year droughts, have significant detrimental impacts on both the natural environment and human societies, especially in regions like the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), which is Australia's largest agricultural area and river system. These prolonged droughts, lasting two or more years, can lead to major losses in agricultural production, as seen during the Millennium Drought, which also caused severe ecological damage (Falster et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "Research on the long-term frequency, persistence, and severity of Australian droughts is limited, partly due to the short observational record relative to the duration of these events (Falster et al., 2024). Understanding the full range of variability in multi-year droughts and how it may change with climate change is crucial for responsible water management (Falster et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, anthropogenic forcing plays a role in influencing Australian multi-year droughts, though the extent and mechanisms are still under investigation (Falster et al., 2024). For further context, Kiem et al. (2016) provide a detailed analysis of natural hazards, including droughts, in Australia, highlighting their complex nature and impacts.\n"

Flooding resulted in the Hawkesbury–Nepean River system in early March; flood heights exceeded levels reached in March 2021 and were comparable to those of 1978.

The loss of sea ice also affects the behaviour of marine species, including seals, penguins, and whales, which rely on the ice for hunting and breeding.\\n\\nSea-ice extent values are calculated from sea-ice concentrations based on satellite passive-microwave ice concentration data (Cavalieri et al., 1996, updated yearly, for 1979–2021; Maslanik & Stroeve, 1999, for observations during 2022).\\n\\nAntarctic sea-ice extent anomaly (x10\" km’) for 2022 T T —t 3 T T T T Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun.

The Bureau uses the 1961–1990 period as the climate reference period for the Annual Climate Statement and other climate monitoring products.\\n\\nA minimum 30 years of data is required to form a robust climatological average, accounting for decadal variability. In general, baseline climatological periods try to make use of the period with the best data coverage. The 1961–1990 period is comparable to the first 30-year period where there is good global coverage of climate data, and is thus used as a benchmark for reporting climate change allowing consistent comparison of national temperature observations across countries.

However, there is substantial variation in how well events can be attributed to human-induced climate change, depending on the nature of the event. Focusing on Australia: at one end of the scale, large-scale heat events on both the land and in the ocean are well suited to attribution studies because climate models simulate them reasonably well, there are high-quality observations available and our understanding of the processes that lead to extreme heat events is reasonably well developed. At the other end of the scale, very important phenomenon such as changes in east coast lows, severe convective storms and long-term droughts are less well observed, are beyond our current capability to robustly simulate in climate models and the complex mechanisms that lead to intensification are not well understood.

Australia experiences high inter-annual climate variability, driven in part by large-scale modes of variability that interact on multiple timescales (Risbey et al., 2009). The prominent role played by El Ni˜no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Southern Annual Mode (SAM), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and the impact of changing ozone forcing means that assessing the role of human-induced climate change on weather and climate extremes in the Australian region, and carefully distinguishing this from natural variability, is'),\n",

In addition, each method involves its own choices and has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, when employing an empirical methodology and applying a statistical fit such as the Generalised Extreme Value distribution to the data, a choice must be made as to whether to include the event in question in informing the fit. This can make a substantial difference to the return period and the FAR estimate, particularly for events that are very extreme or rare in the current climate, such as the Western North American heatwave of 2021 (Philip et al., 2020). Similar considerations would need to be addressed when attributing very extreme Australian events, with any effect on the attribution statement clearly stated. Moreover, there is greater'),\n",

From two sets of model simu- lations – one without human-induced climate forcings (sometimes called a “counterfactual” climate) and one that includes human-induced climate forcings (sometimes called the “factual” climate) - the change in the probability of an event can be calculated.

Australian phenomena\\n\\nExtreme weather events result from the interaction of multiple phenomenon and processes, all occurring in a system perturbed by human-induced climate change. The behaviour and dominant mecha- nisms of different weather events vary by region. They depend on large- scale climate variability and synoptic- and small-scale processes. Moreover, depending on the event type, there is varying scientific un- derstanding of the influence of human-induced climate change on the event, differing quality and quantity of observational records, and differing realism of their representation in climate models. Rigorous event attribution studies require three key elements: robust observa- tions, scientific understanding, and realistic climate modelling. Conse- quently, some events can be attributed to climate drivers, including anthropogenic climate change, more robustly than others.'),\n",

In Australia, cold extremes result from a variety of synoptic weather setups, including positive pressure anomalies advecting air from further south, creating a cold outbreak (Ashcroft et al., 2009; Pook et al., 2012). Enhanced pressure in the mid-latitudes due to greenhouse forcing (Gillett et al., 2013) has the potential to drive more clear nights. For some regions of southern Australia, frost frequency and the length of the frost season has been increasing despite an increase in mean temperature in all seasons (Crimp et al., 2016; Dittus et al., 2014). Changes may also be driven by modifications to the strength and latitude of storm tracks or through changes to atmospheric blocking.'),\n",

However, the proposed drivers of forced response are primarily circulation-based, and climate models perform poorly in the simulation of some important circulation features such as blocking. Climate models are also limited in their skill in simulating the smaller-scale effects related to frosts such as fine scale topography. There is therefore only medium confidence in the ability of climate models to guide attribution of these events over Australia (see Table 1). Advancements in climate model resolution should improve representations of synoptic variability and local risk factors and improve our confidence in their use for event attribution applications.'),\n",

Larger extreme heat events in both time and space tend to display a stronger human-induced signal, likely due to the smaller influence of internal variability (Ang´elil et al., 2014; Fischer et al., 2013). Significant human-induced signals have been detected for Australia’s then-record temperatures of the 2012/2013 summer, and 2013 September, Spring and calendar year (Knutson et al., 2014; Lewis and Karoly, 2014). The May 2014 heatwave was found to be over 20 times more likely to occur due to human-induced climate change (Perkins and Gibson, 2015), and approximately half of the record heat in October 2015 was attributed to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (Hope et al., 2016), with the rest due to atmospheric variability.

For example, physical climate models simulate land-atmosphere feedbacks on the boundary layer inconsistently (Hirsch et al., 2019; Ukkola et al., 2018) which might affect the intensity of multi-day heatwaves (Miralles et al., 2014). The simulation of synoptic systems conducive to heatwaves and associated dynamics is also ques- tionable (Gibson et al., 2017). Heatwaves are also highly sensitive to internal climate variability (Gibson et al., 2017a; Perkins-Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Perkins-Kirkpatrick & Lewis, 2020).

First, based on the analysis of observations and climate models, it was found to be very likely that an event of the unprecedented 2015/16 Tasman Sea MHW duration and intensity was respectively ≥ 330 times and ≥ 6 times as likely due to human-induced climate change (Oliver et al., 2017).

While many different definitions of drought exist (Mishra and Singh, 2010), events are normally triggered by a sustained rainfall anomaly, leading to declines in streamflow, soil moisture or vegetation function. Describing how unusual multi-year droughts are in a historical context is difficult given limited instrumental data. The observational rainfall record extends to around 1900, and back to around 1860 in the southeast and east of the country (Ashcroft et al., 2014). Paleoclimate data, recorded histories of early European settlement (Fenby and Gergis, 2013; Nicholls, 1988) and potentially aboriginal oral history can extend this record for some regions. Drought reconstructions of ENSO and the IOD using proxies including corals, speleothems, tree rings and lake sediment cores, provide valuable long-term drought-like metrics (Abram et'),\n",

This Clausius-Clapeyron scaling underpins thermodynamic explanations of why precipitation extremes increase with global warming (Westra et al., 2014). At global scales, radiation plays a key role in constraining precipitation increases to 2–3% per oC (Stephens and Ellis, 2008). At smaller time and spatial scales, precipitation is more closely tied to column water vapour and rainfall extremes can increase at more than the Clausius-Clapeyron rate. For some organized precipitating systems, horizontal moisture conver- gence can lead to super Clausius-Clapeyron (i.e., >7% per oC) scaling (Bao et al., 2017). Changes in storm intensity can also be associated with changes in stability and moisture (Singh and O’Gorman, 2015). Dy- namics also play a critical role at regional scales in explaining rainfall intensification by influencing moisture availability, stability (e.g., Convective'),\n",

There is evidence of a change toward more episodic rainfall at the expense of persistent, multi-day rainfall events (Dey et al., 2020). However, there are also marked regional and seasonal variations in changes depending on how extreme rainfall is classified (intensity, frequency, duration), what data and metrics are used (Alex- ander and Arblaster, 2017; King et al., 2013a,b), and what frequency (daily to multi-day) and time period (decadal to centennial) are considered (Jakob et al., 2020; Osburn et al., 2021).

These models do not represent the dynamics of thunderstorms realisti- cally, which causes significant errors in rainfall intensity (Stephens et al., 2010). Accordingly, over Australia climate models poorly simulate the spatial pattern of observed trends in the wettest day of the year (Rx1day) and the number of wet days (Alexander and Arblaster, 2017). CMIP5 (Alexander and Arblaster, 2017) and CMIP6 models (Grose et al., 2020) show widespread projected increases in Rx1day across Australia, with amplified trends in the tropics, broadly consistent with thermo- dynamic arguments (Roderick et al., 2019). However, low confidence exists for projections for Rx1day across all of Australia for the reasons given above (Alexander and Arblaster, 2017).'),\n",

Annual numbers are affected by the phase of ENSO, and intra- seasonal variability is linked to the MJO. Observed Australian cyclone numbers have decreased over the last 30–40 years – consistent with international trends (Knutson et al., 2020). Modelled changes for the Australian region over past and future time-scales also suggest a reduction in numbers (Bruy`ere et al., 2020, 2022; Cattiaux et al., 2020; Chand et al., 2019). Conversely, there has been a clear and substantial increase in the proportion of intense cyclones (Category 4 and 5) (Bruy`ere et al., 2020; 2022; Knutson et al., 2020).

ECLs are typically smaller than other extratropical cyclones and follow a trajectory along the coast due to the Great Dividing Range of eastern Australia and the strong gradients associated with the warm eddies of the East Australian Current (EAC). They are major contributors to damage and societal disruption, but also often provide crucial replenishments of water storages (Bruy`ere et al., 2020). We focus on all types of ECLs, particularly those that occur close to the coast, including warm-cored systems with surface winds close to the centre, more spread out cold-cored systems, and hybrids of the two including tropical cyclones undergoing extratropical transition.

For example, some studies include only coastal systems, while others include extratropical cyclones well out into the Tasman Sea; and some definitions produce ECL numbers that are an order of magnitude higher than others. The capacity to attribute changes in ECLs to climate change is limited by the relatively short period of observations, the large annual and decadal variability, especially for extreme ECLs, and the poor capacity of climate models to resolve ECLs (Lane et al., 2019). As such, there have been no attribution\\n\\nassessments of ECLs to date.'),\n",

There also is low-medium confidence that the upward trend in summer systems will continue into the future as a result of climate change (Cavicchia et al., 2020) and that in winter a decreased frequency of ECLs may be expected as the planet warms (Pepler et al., 2016). Given their importance to the most populated seaboard of Australia, and the uncertainties with their response to climate change, further dedicated research in this area is strongly recommended. An agreed definition and classification of ECL is important, perhaps following (Cavicchia et al., 2020), but sustained efforts to explore the behaviour of ECLs is also required.

Fronts are also a critical component of fire weather, especially in southeastern Australia (Cai et al., 2022). Methods for identifying and tracking extratropical cyclones and fronts have predominantly used reanalysis products for the Australian region (Pepler et al., 2020), though some studies have supplemented these with operational weather charts (Pook et al., 2012). Therefore, detection of long-term changes is limited by the temporal quality and amount of data assimilated into the forecast system and the forecast model itself. However, studies analysing the observational and reanalysis products over the satellite era have, in general, found a reduction in the frequency of fronts and cut-off lows (Hope et al., 2006; Raut et al., 2017; Risbey et al., 2013) over southern Australia during the cool season, and a\\n\\nreduction in the rainfall from fronts (Pepler et al., 2021).'),\n",

Three published studies have examined recent Australian fire events within an attribution framework. (Hope et al., 2019), used a seasonal forecast attribution method to investigate the influence of historical changes in carbon dioxide on the record fire weather conditions over eastern Australia in 2017. While their model was able to resolve a clear response in both temperature and'),\n",

Van Oldenborgh et al.

The primary sources of fuel globally are woody and herbaceous plants, yielding two broad classes of fuel with distinct properties, arrangements and accu- mulation rates (Bradstock, 2010). In environments dominated by grassy fuels, the amount and continuity of fuel strongly constrains the occur- rence of wildfire, whereas the primary constraints in litter-based fuel systems are typically fuel dryness and fire weather, rather than fuel amount (Bradstock, 2010; Clarke et al., 2020). Australia’s high diversity of fuel types and climate regions results in a large number of distinct fire regimes, including infrequent but high intensity litter- and bark-driven fires in the southern and eastern extremities, and frequent low in- tensity grass-fuelled fires in the monsoonal north (Murphy et al., 2013).

However, evidence from free-air carbon dioxide enrichment experiments suggests more complex effects than are currently parameterised in DGVMs (US Department of Energy, 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Further, although DGVMs and the fire modules derived from them provide an ideal framework for addressing detection and attribution, they are still limited in their ability to simu- late observed fuel loads and associated fire risk (Forkel et al., 2019; Sanderson and Fisher, 2020).

Mechanisms include wind-driven currents, set-up from breaking waves, a barometric rise in response to low atmospheric pressures, and the angle and speed of storm approach to the coast. Local bathymetry and coastal characteristics are important factors in storm surge assessments. Concurrent riverine flooding also increases the surge height.

The earliest event attribution analyses both in Australia (King et al., 2013; Lewis and Karoly, 2013) and elsewhere (Pall et al., 2011; Stott et al., 2004) tended to rely on a single method such as the use of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models or sea surface tempera- ture forced models with and without human influences. Recently, studies have tended to employ multiple different modelling and obser- vational techniques more often, in an attempt to better account for uncertainties in quantifications of human-associated forcings (van Old- enborgh et al., 2021a).

As heat extremes have become more common than cold extremes (Lewis and King, 2015) we have seen far more studies on the former (Arblaster et al., 2014; Black et al., 2015; King et al., 2015; Lewis and Karoly, 2013; Perkins et al., 2013) than the latter (Grose et al., 2018). However, essentially all these studies have focused primarily on statistical analyses of a single variable (in this case temperature), which is the outcome of a sequence of processes. For example, there is growing knowledge of the dynamical mechanisms leading to heat extremes in Australia – specifically Rossby wave breaking and the links between tropical cyclones or active tropical convection to the northwest of Australia and heatwaves in southeast Australia (Parker et al., 2014; Parker et al., 2013). Unfortunately, there have been no event attribution studies focusing on the analysis of the weather systems (e.g., Rossby wave breaking)'),\n",

Other examples include studying storm environments in the context of severe storms and studying extreme fronts in the context of fire weather events, etc. Thus, there are opportunities to extend event attribution to focus on the changing nature of the processes and weather systems responsible for the extremes, rather than the extremes of simple variables like temperature and rainfall.\\n\\n5.3.

Finally, there is insufficient model capability in simulating these extremes. Sanderson and Fisher (2020), for example, provide a discussion of the inadequacies in the representation of Australian fires in the current set of earth system models. As understanding of these ex- tremes and their simulation in climate models improve then we may expect more analyses of weather and climate extremes not previously studied in an event attribution framework. This may be facilitated by improvements in attribution methods or multi-method attributions, or changes in model capability facilitated by convection-permitting modelling (see below). However, some of the physical characteristics of these extremes (i.e., small-scale, short duration) are likely to be poorly represented in climate models for some time, thereby limiting our confidence in event attribution studies.\\n\\n5.4.

More recently, however, there have been attempts to quantify the effects of human-induced climate change on specific impacts of extreme events. In particular, there has been growing focus on the effect of extreme heat events on human health with work attempting to attribute additional heat-related deaths to human-caused climate change (Mitchell et al., 2016). Attri- bution of structural and economic damage during extreme rainfall events to human-induced climate change has also been attempted (e.g., Frame et al., 2020; Schaller et al., 2016). However, whether trends in losses can be attributed to climate change in Australia is unclear (Gissing et al., 2021), although this is less critical than in low-income regions (King et al., 2023). The success of impact-based attribution is more complex than that of the extreme event itself, since it not only relies on the ability of climate'),\n",

One of the earliest analyses aimed at enabling real-time event attribu- tion statements focussed on Australian national and state-wide tem- peratures that exceeded existing records (Lewis et al., 2014). Using pre-existing multi-model ensembles that had been evaluated for pre-defined regions, (Lewis et al., 2014) created a set of tables that could be referred to for immediate statements in the aftermath of a new na- tional or state-wide temperature record.

There are multiple definitions of “compound event” but most reflect the joint occurrence of two or more hazards and/or drivers (Ridder et al., 2020; Zscheischler et al., 2018) as distinct from the occurrence of a single hazard. For example, one common compound event is the co-occurrence of strong winds and heavy pre- cipitation associated with fronts, cyclones, and thunderstorms (Dowdy and Catto, 2017) where structural damage incurred by wind-driven rain can occur at wind speeds below meteorological maxima. Given how hard it is to simulate some single hazards (e.g. extreme rainfall) in climate models, it might be expected that these models would lack useful skill in calculating the joint probability of two rare (99th percentile) meteorological phenomena.'),\n",

A logical extension of this was to extend the methodology to warmer climates we may experience in the future (Christidis et al., 2014) and to extend this framework to specific global warming levels such as those in the Paris Agreement (King et al., 2017; Lewis et al., 2017; Perkins-Kirkpatrick and Gibson, 2017). There are several emerging techniques in this space, including using the seasonal-forecast based attribution approach with the addition of an estimate of the change in background climate in a future world. One study used the doubled observed trend as a proxy for a warmer world (Lim et al., 2019). As a greater focus in climate science is placed on extremes generally, we would expect to see more work that employs event-attribution methodologies to make projections of ex- tremes under further'),\n",

A step-change in physical model realism occurs when models achieve kilometre scale horizontal grid spacing, allowing convective processes to be explicitly simulated (Palmer and Stevens, 2019). Such advances could allow many of those extremes that received a Low or Medium in the model capability category in Table 1/Fig. 1 to have increased modelling confidence. Expanded use of convection-permitting regional climate modelling (in the near term), and convection-permitting global climate modelling (in the longer term) holds great promise for improved understanding and projections of ex- tremes and could be utilised for event attribution studies.
